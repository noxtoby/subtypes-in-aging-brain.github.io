The Rotterdam Study was designed in the mid-1980s as a response to the demographic changes worldwide that were leading to an increase of the proportion of elderly people. It was clear that this would result in a dramatic increase in the number of persons living with chronic diseases, especially those with multi-morbidity, as most diseases cluster at the end of life. In order to discover the causes of diseases and thereby identify potential targets for preventive interventions one would have to study risk factors of those diseases. A major approach to finding causes is the prospective follow-up study, which had proven highly effective in finding causes of heart disease and cancer.

The participants in the Rotterdam Study are followed for a variety of diseases that are frequent in the elderly, which include but are not exclusive to coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease and other dementias, depression and anxiety disorders, macular degeneration and glaucoma, COPD, emphysema, liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, dermatological diseases and cancer.
